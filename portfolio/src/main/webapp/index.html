      <p> Hello! My name is Khadija and I am a sophomore at Pomona College majoring in 
          Computer Science and Africana Studies. I am originally from NY but now I go to school in California(the weather is usually amazing, but it does get cold!)
          I love music, especially Soul and RnB. I am also a reader, I love reading all types of books. </p>
    <p> Projects! </p>
      <p> Since I am a sophomore I do not have many projects but this is what I have worked on!</p>
     <ul> 
         <li> Hackathon App</li>
         <li> Social Issues in Computer Sciene Classrooms: Designed a final project for computer science intro course, pertaining to social issue. </li>
         <li> Building Autotester for school website</li>
     </ul>
    <p> A favorite Photo of mine. The colors, design and such really intrigued me. </p> 
      <img src="/images/beauty .jpg"  alt="Black Woman" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
    <p> I now live in Staten Island and this is the view I usually see when I am on the ferry!</p>
        <img src ="/images/NYC.jpg" alt= "Statue of Liberty, City view" style="width: 200px; height:200px;">
    <p> I love taking photos of my friends and the things around me. My friends are beautiful and taking pictures of things around helps me capture memories and feelings I have at the time. It allows me to go back to a photo and ignite forgotten memories!.
        I also love photography in general and keep cool photos.These two pictures are some that I found intruguing.</p>
        <img src ="/images/IMG_1820.jpg" alt="pool" style=" width 250px; height:200px";>
        <img src ="/images/IMG_1821.jpg" alt ="bike" style=" width 250px; height:200px";>
    
    <p> I cannot think of any special talents I have but I have several hobbies. They include bingeing 90's TV shows like Living Single, Fresh Prince, Family Matters! I also have a knack at finding samples for songs.</p>
